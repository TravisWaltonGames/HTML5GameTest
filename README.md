# HTML5GameTest

A simple test of an HTML5/canvas game for itch.io

Clone the repo and open the index.html file locally and you should see a page with a canvas with a red dot that follows the mouse. Click in the canvas to make sure it has focus and then press space to place a png file sprite and play a wav.

Nothing much here, just the few basics I needed to figure out to start making games.

To upload this to Itch.io, clone the repo, then just create a zip file containing index.html, game.js, the png and the wav. You should be able to upload that to itch.io and mark it as "plays from the page".
